Dictionary-Based Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher Solver

This program will be able to solve a monoalphabetic substitution cipher using a dictionary-based solution.  For this type of cipher, a dictionary can be as a reference tool.  A dictionary-based solution to this problem is where each decryption attempt will be checked against a dictionary, or list of words.  This will eliminate the need of an English-speaking mediator to determine if the correct substitution has been made.  The program is able to determine if the correct substitution has been made by comparing the message with words from the dictionary.  

This project will need to be able to read an enciphered message from a text file.  From this message, a letter frequency count will need to be conducted.  Using known letter frequencies, a probable substitution will need to be attempted.  Using this probable substitution, the program will need to check that the decipher attempt contains English words.  If the deciphered message matches with words from the dictionary, the message will be printed for inspection.  If the deciphered message does not match with words from the dictionary, a new probable substitution will be attempted.  This will continue until the message is deciphered.
